# JDBC MySQL Data Access Object Project

This is a simple implementation of a Data Access Object pattern using Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It allows you to perform CRUD operations for two entities: Seller and Department. The project was developed by following the instructions provided by Nelio Alves in [his Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo) on Udemy.
